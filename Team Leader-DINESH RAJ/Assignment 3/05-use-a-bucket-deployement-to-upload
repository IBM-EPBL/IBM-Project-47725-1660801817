Use a bucket deployment to upload a file to S3 when deploying a CDK stack

Instead of manually uploading our assets, let's create an assets folder in our todo application and upload those assets automatically.

+1 We'll be using the aws-s3-deployment deployment construct to do that.

Create an assets directory in the root of the project and add a test file to it.

Run:

npm install --save @aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment
Import it to our todo app:

import * as s3Deployment from "@aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment";

Then add the deployment:

new s3Deployment.BucketDeployment(this, "DeployLogo", {
    destinationBucket: logoBucket,
    // an array of sources
    sources: [s3Deployment.Source.asset("./assets")]
});
Once we run cdk deploy our test file should be safe and sound in our todo s3 bucket.
